# Movie Trailer Website
This project will generate a static web page that allows visitors to browse my favorite movies and watch the trailer for each. This is achieved with the use of server-side code that stores a list of my favorite movies and attributes of each such as movie title, box art or poster URL, and a YouTube link to the trailer.

## Getting Started
In order to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing please see the instructions below.

### Prerequisites
- Python 2.7.13 installed. To download - go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2713/).

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) or [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/features.html?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAjw_dTMBRBHEiwApIzn_LkIhLMmU2yEU8pU-EfT_9fzVZ2YfH0S3Pk63j-6YulHZt-buUfuohoC7hIQAvD_BwE&dclid=CImvofPc3tUCFRfdYgodupMCzw) browser installed. 

### Installing
Download [Movie-Trailer-Website](https://github.com/doobieroo/Movie-Trailer-Website).

## Unit Testing
To test this code, run entertainment_center.py from an IDLE session. A browser window should pop up with the static web page of favorite movies.

To change any of the movies or their attributes, edit entertainment_center.py and change an instance of the class Movie to whatever you like. Remember to also change the name of the movie in the movie list.
